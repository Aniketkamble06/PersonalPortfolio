        <h1>MYSQL</h1>
        <p>What is Database? <br><br>
            It is very important to understand the database before learning MySQL. A database is an application that
            stores the organized collection of records. It can be accessed and manage by the user very easily. It allows
            us to organize data into tables, rows, columns, and indexes to find the relevant information very quickly.
            Each database contains distinct API for performing database operations such as creating, managing,
            accessing, and searching the data it stores. Today, many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle,
            MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc. In this section, we are going to focus on MySQL mainly. <br><br>
            <br><br>



            What is MySQL? <br><br>
            MySQL is currently the most popular database management system software used for managing the relational
            database. It is open-source database software, which is supported by Oracle Company. It is fast, scalable,
            and easy to use database management system in comparison with Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. It
            is commonly used in conjunction with PHP scripts for creating powerful and dynamic server-side or web-based
            enterprise applications. <br><br>

            It is developed, marketed, and supported by MySQL AB, a Swedish company, and written in C programming
            language and C++ programming language. The official pronunciation of MySQL is not the My Sequel; it is My
            Ess Que Ell. However, you can pronounce it in your way. Many small and big companies use MySQL. MySQL
            supports many Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc. with C, C++, and Java languages. <br><br>

            MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) software that provides many things, which are as
            follows: <br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> It allows us to implement database operations on tables, rows, columns, and
            indexes.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It defines the database relationship in the form of tables (collection of rows and
            columns), also known as
            relations.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>It provides the Referential Integrity between rows or columns of various tables.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>It allows us to updates the table indexes automatically.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>It uses many SQL queries and combines useful information from multiple tables for the
            end-users.<br><br><br><br>




            History of MySQL<br><br>
            The project of MySQL was started in 1979 when MySQL's inventor Michael Widenius developed an in-house
            database tool called UNIREG for managing databases. After that, UNIREG has been rewritten in several
            different languages and extended to handle big databases. After some time, Michael Widenius contacted David
            Hughes, the author of mSQL, to see if Hughes would be interested in connecting mSQL to UNIREG's B+ ISAM
            handler to provide indexing to mSQL. That's the way MySQL came into existence.<br><br>


            MySQL is named after the daughter of co-founder Michael Widenius whose name is "My".<br><br><br><br>







            <b style="font-size: 22px;"> MySQL Features</b><br><br>
            MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the SQL (Structured Query Language)
            queries. It is one of the most popular languages for accessing and managing the records in the table. MySQL
            is open-source and free software under the GNU license. Oracle Company supports it.<br><br>

            The following are the most important features of MySQL:<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</b><br><br>

            MySQL is a relational database management system. This database language is based on the SQL queries to
            access and manage the records of the table.<br><br>


            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Easy to use</b><br>
            MySQL is easy to use. We have to get only the basic knowledge of SQL. We can build and interact with MySQL
            by using only a few simple SQL statements.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> It is secure</b><br>
            MySQL consists of a solid data security layer that protects sensitive data from intruders. Also, passwords
            are encrypted in MySQL.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Client/ Server Architecture</b><br>
            MySQL follows the working of a client/server architecture. There is a database server (MySQL) and
            arbitrarily many clients (application programs), which communicate with the server; that is, they can query
            data, save changes, etc.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Free to download</b><br>
            MySQL is free to use so that we can download it from MySQL official website without any cost.<br><br>


            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> It is scalable</b><br>
            MySQL supports multi-threading that makes it easily scalable. It can handle almost any amount of data, up to
            as much as 50 million rows or more. The default file size limit is about 4 GB. However, we can increase this
            number to a theoretical limit of 8 TB of data.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Speed</b><br>
            MySQL is considered one of the very fast database languages, backed by a large number of the benchmark
            test.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> High Flexibility</b><br>
            MySQL supports a large number of embedded applications, which makes MySQL very flexible.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Compatible on many operating systems</b><br>
            MySQL is compatible to run on many operating systems, like Novell NetWare, Windows* Linux*, many varieties
            of UNIX* (such as Sun* Solaris*, AIX, and DEC* UNIX), OS/2, FreeBSD*, and others. MySQL also provides a
            facility that the clients can run on the same computer as the server or on another computer (communication
            via a local network or the Internet).<br><br>


            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Allows roll-back</b><br>
            MySQL allows transactions to be rolled back, commit, and crash recovery.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Memory efficiency</b><br>
            Its efficiency is high because it has a very low memory leakage problem.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> High Performance</b><br>
            MySQL is faster, more reliable, and cheaper because of its unique storage engine architecture. It provides
            very high-performance results in comparison to other databases without losing an essential functionality of
            the software. It has fast loading utilities because of the different cache memory.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> High Productivity</b><br>
            MySQL uses Triggers, Stored procedures, and views that allow the developer to give higher
            productivity.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Platform Independent</b><br>
            It can download, install, and execute on most of the available operating systems.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Partitioning</b><br>
            This feature improves the performance and provides fast management of the large database.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> GUI Support</b><br>
            MySQL provides a unified visual database graphical user interface tool named "MySQL Workbench" to work with
            database architects, developers, and Database Administrators. MySQL Workbench provides SQL development, data
            modeling, data migration, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user
            administration, backup, and many more. MySQL has a fully GUI supports from MySQL Server version 5.6 and
            higher.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Dual Password Support</b><br>
            MySQL version 8.0 provides support for dual passwords: one is the current password, and another is a
            secondary password, which allows us to transition to the new password.<br><br><br><br>



            <b style="font-size: 22px;"> Disadvantages/Drawback of MySQL</b><br>
            Following are the few disadvantages of MySQL:<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL version less than 5.0 doesn't support ROLE, COMMIT, and stored procedure.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL does not support a very large database size as efficiently.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL doesn't handle transactions very efficiently, and it is prone to data
            corruption.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL is accused that it doesn't have a good developing and debugging tool compared to
            paid databases.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL doesn't support SQL check constraints.<br><br><br><br>



            <b style="font-size: 22px;"> How MySQL Works?</b><br><br>
            MySQL follows the working of Client-Server Architecture. This model is designed for the end-users called
            clients to access the resources from a central computer known as a server using network services. Here, the
            clients make requests through a graphical user interface (GUI), and the server will give the desired output
            as soon as the instructions are matched. The process of MySQL environment is the same as the client-server
            model.<br><br>

            MySQL
            The core of the MySQL database is the MySQL Server. This server is available as a separate program and
            responsible for handling all the database instructions, statements, or commands. The working of MySQL
            database with MySQL Server are as follows:<br><br>

            MySQL creates a database that allows you to build many tables to store and manipulate data and defining the
            relationship between each table.
            Clients make requests through the GUI screen or command prompt by using specific SQL expressions on MySQL.
            Finally, the server application will respond with the requested expressions and produce the desired result
            on the client-side.
            A client can use any MySQL GUI. But, it is making sure that your GUI should be lighter and user-friendly to
            make your data management activities faster and easier. Some of the most widely used MySQL GUIs are MySQL
            Workbench, SequelPro, DBVisualizer, and the Navicat DB Admin Tool. Some GUIs are commercial, while some are
            free with limited functionality, and some are only compatible with MacOS. Thus, you can choose the GUI
            according to your needs.<br><br><br><br>



            <b style="font-size: 22px;">  Reasons for popularity</b><br>
            MySQL is becoming so popular because of these following reasons:<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL is an open-source database, so you don't have to pay a single penny to use it.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL is a very powerful program that can handle a large set of functionality of the most expensive and
            powerful database packages.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL is customizable because it is an open-source database, and the open-source GPL license facilitates
            programmers to modify <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL is quicker than other databases, so it can work well even with the large data set.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>  MySQL supports many operating systems with many languages like PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>MySQL is very friendly with PHP, the most popular language for web development.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a
            table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8
            million terabytes (TB).he SQL software according to their own specific environment.<br>
