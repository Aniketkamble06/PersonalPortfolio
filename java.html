        <h1>JAVA</h1>
        <p> <b style="font-size: 22px; ">What is Java?</b><br><br>
            Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
            It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
            Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser
            implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure,
            and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game
            consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.<br><br><br>

            <b style="font-size: 22px;"> It is used for:</b><br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>  Web Applications<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>  Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Mobile<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Embedded System<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>Smart Card<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Robotics<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Games<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Database connection<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> And much, much more! etc.<br><br><br>



            <b style="font-size: 22px;">History of Java?</b><br><br>
            The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was
            too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts
            with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a
            language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for
            internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

            The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured,
            High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was
            developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members
            started the project in the early '90s.<br><br><br>


            <b style="font-size: 22px;">Why Use Java?</b> <br><br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It is one of the most popular programming language in the world<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It has a large demand in the current job market<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It is easy to learn and simple to use<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>It is open-source and free<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>It is secure, fast and powerful<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused,
            lowering development costs<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa<br><br><br>

            <b style="font-size: 22px;">Types of Java Applications</b><br>

            There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:<br>
            <b> 1) Standalone Application</b><br><br>

            Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are
            traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media
            player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.<br><br>
            <b>2) Web Application</b><br><br>

            An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application.
            Currently, Servlet <br>
            , JSP<br>
            , Struts<br>
            , Spring<br>
            , Hibernate<br>
            , JSF<br>
            , etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.<br><br>
             <b>3) Enterprise Application</b><br><br>

            An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise
            application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB
            is used for creating enterprise applications.<br><br>
            <b> 4) Mobile Application</b><br><br>

            An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and
            Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.<br>
