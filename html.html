        <p><b style="font-size: 22px;"> What is HTML?</b><br><br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> HTML describes the structure of a Web page<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> HTML consists of a series of elements<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a
            paragraph", "this is a link",
            etc.<br><br><br>

            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for
            CERN
            researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
            That
            year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
            funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed
            "some
            of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.<br><br>

            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on
            the
            Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
            simple
            design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house
            Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
            still exist in HTML 4.<br><br>

            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other
            material
            into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in
            the
            browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use
            of
            CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using
            SGML,
            which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
            command
            developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these
            formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
            However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with
            attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has
            been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.<br><br>

            Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the
            Internet
            Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
            specification,
            the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an
            SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.The draft expired after six months, but was notable
            for
            its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the
            IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing
            Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
            already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.<br><br>

            After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in
            1995
            completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which
            future
            implementations should be based.<br><br>

            Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the
            HTML
            specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000).
            HTML
            4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began
            on
            HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint
            deliverable
            with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.<br><br><br>


            <b style="font-size: 22px;"> Web Browsers </b><br>
            The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them
            correctly.<br>

            A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document: <br><br>
