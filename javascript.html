        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>  <b style="font-size: 22px; ">What is JavaScript? </b><br><br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript is easy to learn.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming
            language which is also
            known as the scripting language for webpages.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It is designed for creating network-centric applications.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>It is complimentary to and integrated with Java.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
            developments.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. <br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a
            core set of language
            elements like operators, control structures, and statements.<br><br><br><br>


            <b style="font-size: 22px; "> History of JavaScript?</b><br><br>
            In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded
            by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was
            believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers.
            Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme
            programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun
            Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web
            technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further,
            Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'.
            Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the
            marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons,
            in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into
            existence.<br><br><br><br>


            <b style="font-size: 22px; ">  Features of JavaScript?</b><br>
            There are following features of JavaScript:<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution
            environments.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is
            a structured
            <span>&#8226;</span> programming language.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast
            (depending on the
            operation).<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than
            using classes for
            inheritance.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It is a case-sensitive language.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS,
            etc.<br>
            <span>&#8226;</span> It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.<br><br><br><br>



            <b style="font-size: 22px; ">  Applications of JavaScript: </b><br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>  <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Web Development:</b> Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was
            invented to do this in
            1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>  <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Web Applications:</b> With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language
            was required to
            create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the
            mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses
            Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is
            helpful in this department.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>  <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Server Applications:</b> With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to
            server and node.js is
            the most powerful on the server-side.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Games:</b> only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure.
            The combination of
            JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library
            which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Smartwatches:</b> JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It
            provides a library
            PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the
            internet for its functioning.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Art:</b> Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on
            HTML 5 canvas, and make
            the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Machine Learning:</b> This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by
            using machine learning.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;">Mobile Applications: </b> can also be used to build an application for non-web
            contexts. The features
            and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications. This is a Framework for
            building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile applications for
            different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different systems. Write once use it
            anywhere!<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>  <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Client side validation -</b> is really important to verify any user input before
            submitting it to the
            server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>  <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Manipulating HTML Pages -</b> Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This
            helps in adding and
            deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on
            different devices and requirements.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>  <b style="font-size: 20px;"> User Notifications -</b> You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to
            give different types
            of notifications to your website visitors.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span>  <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Back-end Data Loading -</b> Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading
            back-end data while you are
            doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.<br><br>

            <span>&#8226;</span> <b style="font-size: 20px;"> Presentations - </b> also provides the facility of creating presentations which
            gives website look and
            feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.
            <br><br><br><br>



            <b style="font-size: 22px; ">  There are many useful Javascript frameworks and libraries available:</b><br><br>

            <span>&#8226; </span> Angular<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> React<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> jQuery<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> Vue.js<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span>Ext.js<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span>Ember.js<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> Meteor<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> Mithril<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span>Node.js<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> Polymer<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> Aurelia<br>
            <span>&#8226; </span> Backbone.js<br>

            It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available Javascript frameworks and libraries.
            The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.<br><br><br><br>



            <b style="font-size: 22px; ">   Why Learn JavaScript?</b><br><br>
            JavaScript is used on both the client-side and the server-side. On the client-side, the code is run and
            displayed by the browser. On the server-side, Node.js is used.<br>
            JavaScript is a platform-independent language. Any browser supporting JavaScript can run the code
            irrespective of the operating system<br>
            JavaScript uses the just-in-time compilation technique. Since the compilation is handled at run time,
            JavaScript is considered an interpreted language.<br>
            JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That is, a variable containing a number may be reassigned to a
            string.<br><br><br><br>
